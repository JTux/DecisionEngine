1. Define the Objective
	Help students which track to decide: Python, JavaScript, .NET

2. Structure Elemeints in Criteria, Sub Criteria, Alternatives

3. Make a pair wise comparison of elements in each group

4. Calculate weighting and consistency ratio.


Objective : Choose a Track for the Bootcamp(Python, JS, .NET)

Criteria  : Placement Time, Layout, Logic
			Placement Time : Immediate, 1 month, 3 months
			Design: More UI Design, Some UI Design, Less UI Design, Barely Any UI
			Experience: Lots of Java, Some Java, 

Alternatives : 
			Placement
				.NET			    :    1-2 months
				JavaScript			:    2-3 months
				Python				:    Unknown


Compare all elements pair wise with respect to the objective.

9 7 5 3 1  1/3  1/5  1/7  1/9

1 means the criteria are equal

Scale: 

9 means one criteria is extreme.
7 very strong
5 strong
3 moderate strong
1 equal
1/3 moderate strong
1/5 strong
1/7 very strong
1/9 extreme


Example:

Logic			vs.   Layout
9 7 5 3 1  1/3  1/5  1/7  1/9
1. User says 9

Logic			vs.   Job Placement
9 7 5 3 1  1/3  1/5  1/7  1/9
2. User says 1/9

Layout			vs.   Job Placement
9 7 5 3 1  1/3  1/5  1/7  1/9
3. User sasy 1/3



Note: Simply notice: The 1s are because 
the comparison is to itself. logic vs logic would be a one. 

		Logic   Layout   Job
Logic     1        9      1/9
Layout    9        1      1/3
Job       1/9      1/3     1


Numerical Rating & Inverse Numerical Rating

			Apples		Oranges
Apples		  1			   9  <--Since this is 9,
Oranges		 1/9		   1
			  ^---this must be the inverse.
